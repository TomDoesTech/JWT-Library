# Create  A JSON Web Token (JWT) Library From Scratch

### What are we building?
* A JSON Web Token (JWT) library with the following functions:
  - Sign
  - Decode
  - Verify

* Following Test Driven Development (TDD) principals
* Using Jest as the test framework
* Bootstrapping the application with [tsdx](https://github.com/formium/tsdx)

### Should I use this in my production code?
* No, please use a trusted library like [`jsonwebtoken` by Auth0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)
* Only if you build out all the features and test, test & then test again

### Why follow this tutorial?
* Learn about testing with Jest & TDD
* Security
  - JWTs protect your systems resources
  - Understanding how each bit of your auth works will help you keep it secure
  - This guide will help you understand how JWTs work
  - Security is important and as a developer it's your job to keep the system secure
